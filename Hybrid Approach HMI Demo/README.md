# Hybrid Approach Flatland + Blackbox HMI Demo

This project combines the T3.4 Flatland environment with a custom Blackbox planner (based on PP and CBS)
and a simple HMI interface for interactive decisions.
The idea is to explore how classical planning methods can be combined with more dynamic or human-in-the-loop approaches in a multi-agent setting, where user interactions (via tokens) make planning decisions more transparent and explainable.

## Features

* Uses Flatland RailEnv scenarios (JSON)
* Supports CBS (Conflict-Based Search) and PP (Prioritized Planning)
* Simple HMI interaction via tokens (e.g. PRIORITY)
* Replanning logic based on user input
* Custom scenario loading from JSON
* Conversion from plans to executable actions



## Reproducibility

There are two requirement files:

* requirements.txt → basic setup to run the project
* requirements_lock.txt → full environment (from pip freeze)

If you want the exact same setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_lock.txt
```



## Running the demo

The repository provides different entry points depending on the use case.

1. Main demo (HMI)
python app_hmi_demo.py
Runs the interactive demo with HMI token selection.

2. Controller demo
python run_controller.py
Runs the planner and controller logic (CBS / PP) without HMI.

3. Basic scenario run
python run_scenario.py
Runs a predefined scenario without replanning or interaction. Useful for testing and debugging.

Scenarios can be changed in the script, for example:
scenario_path = Path("src/environments/simple_avoidance.json")



## HMI interaction

Currently, the system supports simple tokens like:
* PRIORITY → gives one agent preference over another

This mainly affects:
* planning order
* agent delays
* replanning behaviour


## Project structure

Note: The `flatland_blackbox` folder contains a local copy of the Blackbox planner used for CBS and PP.

## Planning

* CBS: more optimal but slower
* PP: faster but can fail in some cases (deadlocks)
* Priority mode: tries to guide planning using HMI input



## Notes

Developed and tested on Windows (conda environment)
Written in Python
Mainly intended as a demo / experiment setup



## Context / Related Projects

This project builds on top of the following external components:
- Flatland (rail environment)
- Blackbox planner (CBS / PP implementation)
This repository does not include a full standalone implementation of these systems.
It mainly provides an integration layer and uses the Blackbox planner for CBS and PP logic.



## Acknowledgements

This project builds on ideas and tools from:
- Flatland environment  
- AI4REALNET  
- multi-agent path finding methods (CBS, PP)
